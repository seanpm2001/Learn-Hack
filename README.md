### Learning Hack (programming language)

I know very little about the Hack programming language. I don't intend to go far with this language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the Hack programming language.

#### Hello World in Hack

This is how you make a Hello World program in Hack:

```hack
<<__EntryPoint>>
function main(): void {
  echo 'Hello, World!';
}
```

#### Comments in Hack

Comments in Hack are the same as in PHP.

##### Single line comments

Single line comments in Hack are written like so:

```hack
<<__EntryPoint>>
// This is a single line comment
```

##### Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments in Hack are written like so:

```hack
<<__EntryPoint>>
/* This is a
* multi-line
* comment */
/* This is 
also a
multi-line
comment
*/
```

#### Break keyword in Hack

```hack
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

I am not sure if Hack supports the `break` keyword

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Shebangs in Hack

Hack has a shebang line that differentiates it from PHP.

```hack
<<__EntryPoint>>
```

#### Functions in Hack

Hack supports functions similarly to PHP. An important thing to note is that a function name has to be unique. You cannot use the same function name across multiple files in the same program.

```hack
<<__EntryPoint>>
function function2(): void {
  echo 'This is a function.';
}
```

#### Return keyword in Hack

Returning a function in Hack is done like so

```hack
<<__EntryPoint>>
function function3(): void {
  echo 'This is a function. It will be returned.';
}
return function3();
```

#### Other knowledge of the Hack programming language

1. Hack is a language by Facebook

2. Hack is a semicolon and curly bracket language

3. Hack uses the `*.php` file extension by default, but also uses the `*.hh` `*.hck` and `*.hack` file extensions

4. Hack is a functional programming language

5. Hack is heavily based on PHP, and works on Facebooks HipHop virtual machine

6. Hack is not one of the top 50 programming languages (as of 2022)

7. Hack was first created in the year 2014

8. No other knowledge of the Hack programming language

#### Additional comments

1. I don't recognize Facebook (the company) by their 2022 name Meta/Meta platforms, as the name is too generic, and doesn't deserve to be used by them

2. The `*.hh` file extension can be mistaken for a C++ program file, as they both use this extension

3. The `*.php` file extension can be mistaken for a PHP program file, as they both use this extension 

4. No other additional comments available
